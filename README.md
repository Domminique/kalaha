## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project aims to develop a functional AI Virtual Assistant specially designed to support ADEIN ambassadors in their various tasks and activities. The Virtual assistant will leverage the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformer ( GPT) technology, specially leveraging Gemini on vertex AI on Google Cloud platform, to process information and respond to queries in a comprehensive and informative way

## PROJECT GOALS
Enhance Ambassador Efficiency: The Virtual Assistant will automate routine tasks and provide easy access to Information, freeing up ambassadorsâ€™ valuable time to focus on strategic initiatives and member engagement 
Improve Knowledge Accessibility: The Virtual Assistant will serve as a central hub for information retrieval, allowing ambassadors to quickly access resources and guidelines outlined in the ambassador playbook and other relevant materials.
Promote Consistency and Best Practices: The Virtual Assistant will ensure consistent messaging and adherence to best practices by providing standardized responses to frequently asked questions and inquiries.
Multilingual Support: The Virtual Assistant will be accessible in all African languages, fostering inclusivity and empowering ambassadors to serve a wider audience across the continent.

## FUNCTIONALITY 
The Virtual Assistant will be equipped with the following functionalities:
Information Retrieval
Ability to answer questions about ADEIN, its mission, programs, resources, and ambassador guidelines, drawing information from the ambassador playbook and other designated sources.
Task Automation
Assist with scheduling meetings, setting reminders, and managing basic communication tasks.
Content Creation
Draft emails, reports, and social media posts based on user prompts and guidelines.
Multilingual Communication
Provide information and complete tasks in all African languages, promoting accessibility and inclusivity.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
The project will leverage Gemini, a large language model from Google AI, on Vertex AI, a managed machine learning platform on Google Cloud Platform. This platform will provide the necessary infrastructure and tools for training and deploying the Virtual Assistant.

### Data Source
The primary data source will be the ADEIN ambassador playbook, along with other relevant materials and resources.

### Training Process
The Virtual Assistant will be trained on the provided data to understand natural language, respond to queries in a comprehensive way, and perform assigned tasks following best practices outlined in the ambassador playbook.

## PROJECT DELIVERABLES 
A functional AI Virtual Assistant prototype capable of answering questions, completing tasks, and generating content relevant to ADEIN ambassadors' needs.
User interface (UI) mockups for integrating the VAssistant into a mobile app, website, or other designated platforms.
Training materials and documentation for ambassadors on how to effectively utilize the Virtual Assistant.

## PROJECT TIMELINE 
Phase 1 (1 week)
Data collection and pre-processing of the ambassador playbook and other relevant materials.
Phase 2 (2 weeks)
 Training the Virtual Assistant model using Gemini on Vertex AI.
Phase 3 (1 week)
Developing UI mockups and integrating the Virtual ssistant into the chosen platform.
Phase 4 (1 week)
Testing and refinement of the Virtual Assistant based on user feedback.
Phase 5 (1 week)
Creating user manuals and training materials for ambassadors.

## SUSTAINABILITY 
The project will be designed for long-term sustainability. The Virtual Assistant can be continuously improved by incorporating new data sources, such as updated ambassador playbooks and feedback from users. 
The use of cloud-based platforms like Vertex AI ensures scalability and facilitates future enhancements.

## CONCLUSION
The ADEIN Ambassador Virtual Assistant (AAVA)  has the potential to be a valuable tool for empowering ambassadors, fostering knowledge sharing, and streamlining communication within the organization.
 This project aligns with ADEIN's mission of leveraging technology for public health advancement and positions the ambassadors at the forefront of innovation in disease prevention across Africa.
